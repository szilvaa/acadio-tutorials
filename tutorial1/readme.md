# Tutorial 1: Convert DWG to PDF
In this tutorial you will convert a public sample dwg file to a pdf file on AWS S3. The conversion is a predefined [activity](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v2/overview/field-guide/) of the service so we simply submit a workitem. The steps were tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux but they should work on your operating system of choice (they only require a web browser and curl utility).
## Step 1: Create a Forge app
This step is common for any Forge workflows. Follow the steps [here](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/create-app/).
## Step 2: Make sure you have Curl
Open a terminal window and type
```
curl
```
If the command is recognized, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you must obtain curl. Visit https://curl.haxx.se/ to download.
## Step 3: Get a 2-legged Oauth token
This step is common for most Forge workflows. Follow the steps [here](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-2-legged-token/). **IMPORTANT**: you must specify `scope=code:all` instead of `scope=data:read`.
## Step 4: Prepare output URL on AWS S3
Follow the [steps](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html) in the AWS documentation to create presigned url in your AWS account. The following screenshots show how to do this if you have [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2015 installed](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/).

1. Right click on the bucket where you want the object to be stored.

2. Fill out the dialog fields, generate and copy the URL.

## Step 5: Create a workitem
The WorkItem is where the source and destination are specified for the input and output files, respectively, and it references the desired Activity to be executed.
We will use the [POST WorkItems](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v2/reference/http/WorkItems-POST) endpoint to create the WorkItem. 
### Step 5.1 Create request body
Create a text file called `workitem.json` in the current folder for your terminal window with the following content:
```json
{
  "Arguments": {
    "InputArguments": [
      {
        "Resource": "http://download.autodesk.com/us/samplefiles/acad/blocks_and_tables_-_imperial.dwg",
        "Name": "HostDwg"
      }
    ],
    "OutputArguments": [
      {
        "Name": "Result",
        "HttpVerb": "PUT",
        "Resource": '<your_presigned_url>'
      }
    ]
  },
  "ActivityId": "PlotToPDF"
}
```
### Step 5.2 Post WorkItem resource
Execute the following command in your terminal window. Please substitute the authorization token you obtained above at `<your token>`.
```
curl https://developer.api.autodesk.com/autocad.io/us-east/v2/WorkItems -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your token>" -d @workitem.json
```
### Step 5.3. Retrieve the workitem id
The above step results in the following response. Copy the Id field.
```
{
  "@odata.context": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/autocad.io/us-east/v2/$metadata#WorkItems/$entity",
  "ActivityId": "PlotToPDF",
  "Arguments": {
    "InputArguments": [
      {
        "Resource": "http://download.autodesk.com/us/samplefiles/acad/blocks_and_tables_-_imperial.dwg",
        "Name": "HostDwg",
        "Headers": [

        ],
        "ResourceKind": null,
        "StorageProvider": null,
        "HttpVerb": null
      }
    ],
    "OutputArguments": [
      {
        "Resource": "<your_presigned_url>",
        "Name": "Result",
        "Headers": [

        ],
        "ResourceKind": null,
        "StorageProvider": null,
        "HttpVerb": "PUT"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Status": "Pending",
  "StatusDetails": {
    "Report": null
  },
  "AvailabilityZone": null,
  "TimeQueued": "<your queue time>",
  "TimeInputTransferStarted": null,
  "TimeScriptStarted": null,
  "TimeScriptEnded": null,
  "TimeOutputTransferEnded": null,
  "BytesTranferredIn": null,
  "BytesTranferredOut": null,
  "Timestamp": "<your time stamp>",
  "Id": "<your workitem id>"
}
```
## Step 6: Query the status of the WorkItem
In this scenario we will query the status of your workitem. **This is NOT recommended in production scenarios**. You would normally provide a callback URL to the service to notify you when the workitem concludes. Subsequent tutorial will demonstrate how to do this.
Execute the following command to query the status of your workitem. 
```
curl https://developer.api.autodesk.com/autocad.io/us-east/v2/WorkItems('<your workitem id>')/Status -H "Authorization: Bearer <your token>"
```
The response from the above request is the following. 
```
{
  "@odata.context": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/autocad.io/us-east/v2/$metadata#WorkItems('<your workitem id>')/Status",
  "value": "Succeeded"
}
```
At this point you can go to your storage account and see the generated PDF file there.
## Step 7: Get the workitem report
Query the workitem object to obtain the “StatusDetails”
```
curl https://developer.api.autodesk.com/autocad.io/us-east/v2/WorkItems('<your workitem id>') -H "Authorization: Bearer <your token>"
```
The response you get will have the same structure as in Step 5.3. Find the StatusDetails object in the response and locate its Report attribute. It should be a longish URL by now (if status is no longer Pending). Then issue a GET requests on the URL:
```
curl <your report url>
```
 You will get something like this. You can use this report to understand the cause of any failures.
